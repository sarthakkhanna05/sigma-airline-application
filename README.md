# XP Core Values that were Implemented 

# Communication
*	Communication has been a vital priority in our team throughout the project. We scheduled our weekly sprint meeting on Monday 10:30 PDT. Since, covid has restricted the chance to meet in person, we have overcome that through platforms like Google Meet, WhatsApp.
*	We have used Google Chats for collaboration and discussions raised on a daily basis. Having a channel to express concerns daily has helped move forward with the project at a great and healthy pace.
*	In each sprint meeting, we thoroughly our monitored progress , discussed key issues in the sprint such as blockers if any and set an agenda for the coming sprint
*	We used JIRA software to monitor our user stories and have an accurate insight of different stages of a task through the sprint.

# Simplicity
*	We have analysed all features in our project and discussed different ways it could be done, choose the simplest one which indeed assured security or 		reliability.
*	To implement true simplicity we have sought each other’s help, shared knowledge and lent helping hand through all sprints.
*	We focused attentively over all requirements and definition of the project, followed the vision to do only what is needed.
*	Actively working on avoiding duplications helped us keep our code easy to maintain as we added more APIs and corresponding UI elements.

# Feedback
*	Feedback played a vital role during the initial stages and testing phase. We were dedicated to listen to everyone’s ideas without interruption.
*	We had a built-in feedback review at the end of every meeting at least for 15 minutes to check on what worked according to the plan and what needs to be 	 corrected in future.
*	During the testing phase, we tested features developed by other team members and gave feedback to each other. It helped us to identify the bugs.
*	Feedback helped us in identifying the roadblocks, improve and perform better.

# Courage
*	Each and every team member was courageous enough to respectfully say no when they feel something in the work is wrong
*	Team members had the courage to speak up, be vulnerable. 
*	Code was visible to everyone all the time throughout the project

# Respect
*	Each and every team received immense respect and put out to the same towards the others.
*	Various perspectives, approaches and suggestions were taken into consideration at each and every stage of the project. 
*	Under unpredicted circumstances, teammates reached out to help each other.
